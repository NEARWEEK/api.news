## Guides

### Configuration

```bash
cp .env.dist .env
# 1. set up variables on .env
# 2. update the template in templates/agreement.docx
# 3. replace the logo in `assets`
```

### Special routes for admin

> These special routes should be moved to the admin panel with a better security. They are protected by a secret URL using ADMIN_TOKEN and basic auth using ADMIN_LOGIN and ADMIN_PASSWORD

#### Invoice downloading

> Use this route to download the invoice

- Route: `/admin/:adminToken/accounts/:nearId/grants/:id/invoices/:invoiceId`
  - `adminToken`: ADMIN_TOKEN from the env variable to authorize the request
  - `nearId`: The near account id of the grant user
  - `id`: The grant id that can be found in the database
  - `invoiceId`: The invoice id (0 for the first payment, 1 for milestone 1, ...)
- Example: `/admin/TdgB349TfjpUnOqQMIIMOQoPf2kU/accounts/sound.testnet/grants/6/invoices/0`

#### Agreement signature

> This route has been created as a workaround because it seems like the hellosign API doesn't allow to have one signer using the embedded widget and the other using the hello sign website; more info here: https://github.com/NEARFoundation/api.grants/issues/22#issuecomment-1180164237

- Route: `/admin/:adminToken/accounts/:nearId/grants/:id/agreement/signature`
  - `adminToken`: ADMIN_TOKEN from the env variable to authorize the request
  - `nearId`: The near account id of the grant user
  - `id`: The grant id that can be found in the database
- Example: `/admin/TdgB349TfjpUnOqQMIIMOQoPf2kU/accounts/sound.testnet/grants/6/agreement/signature`
